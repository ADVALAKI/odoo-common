# Taktik Odoo Common | tk_pos_takeaway

This module adds the ability to chose between eat-in or takeaway in the POS.
Indeed, selecting eat-in or takeaway should modify the taxes of the products
in the current pos order. This is done through the fiscal position of the
partners linked to these buttons.
